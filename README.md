# Coconut

Coconut is a little wiki app written in Sinatra. It aims to be:

* easy to configure
* easy to install
* easy to extend

It's not quite complete but if you want to try it out, just do this:

    git clone git://github.com/mcmire/coconut.git
    cd coconut
    # copy config.yml.example to config.yml and modify to suit your needs
    ruby coconut.rb -p 3000
  
And then go to http://localhost:3000!
