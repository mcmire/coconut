Specs:
 ✔ The index page just lists all the pages in the system
 ✔ Going to a non-empty page shows the content of that page
 ✔ Going to an empty shows a "page empty" message instead and a link to the edit form
 ✔ Clicking on the "edit page" link on a page goes to the edit form for that page
 ✔ Edit form has "save (and return)" and "save & continue" buttons
 - Edit form shows preview side-by-side against textarea
 ✔ Page content when showing a page and previewing a page passes through Markdown (Maruku)
 ✘ Saving a page for the first time should create data/pages/[page name], with meta.yml that stores the current version
 ✔ Saving a page should also add a new file to data/pages/[page name], after the version number
 - Wiki should be password-protected (perhaps just using HTTP)
 ✔ Spaces should be converted to underscores in the URL and back
 ✔ Deleting or renaming a page is straightforward (we're in 2009, after all)
 ✔ Saving a page with the same content doesn't make a new file
 ✔ Creating a page with no content doesn't actually make a new page

Future:
- The index is a soft link to the Special/Index page
- The index is a soft link to a specific page, if it is defined in the config file
- The config file is stored in squeal/config.yml (not required)
- The wiki has a template at data/template.html
- The wiki has a stylesheet at data/template.css
- All config data is editable within the app
- Config variables are hardcoded in the code with the type that they store and/or possible values
- Code blocks are run through Coderay
- Global template and stylesheet are editable within the app
- Going to the history for a page should list all the versions
- Subdirectories
- Custom page title
